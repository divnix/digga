> #### âš  Advisory âš 
> DevOS requires the [flakes][flakes] feature available via an _experimental_
> branch of [nix][nix]. Until nix 2.4 is released, this project
> should be considered unstable.

### Why?
Make an awesome template for NixOS users, with consideration for common tools like [home-manager][home-manager],
[devshell][devshell], and [more](./doc/integrations).

### No. Why _flakes_?
Flakes are a part of an explicit push to improve [Nix's UX](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/blob/master/doc/manual/src/contributing/cli-guideline.md), and have become an intergral part of that effort. 

They also make [Nix expressions](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/unstable/expressions/expression-syntax.html) easier to distribute and reuse with convient [flake references](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/blob/master/src/nix/flake.md#flake-references) for building or using packages, modules, and whole systems.

## Getting Started
Check out the [guide](https://devos.divnix.com/start) to get up and running.
Also, have a look at [_flake.nix_][toc]. If anything is not immediately 
discoverable via "[`digga`][digga]'s [`mkFlake`][mk-flake],
please file a bug report.

### Status: Beta
Although this project has already matured quite a bit, especially through
recent outfactoring of [`digga`][digga], a fair amount of api polishing is still
expected. There are unstable versions (0._x_._x_) to help users keep track
of changes and progress, and a [`develop`](https://github.com/divnix/devos/tree/develop) branch for the brave ðŸ˜œ

## Divnix
The divnix org is an open space that spontaniously formed out of "the Nix".
It is really just a place where otherwise unrelated people a) get
together and b) stuff done.

It's a place to stop "geeking out in isolation" (or within company boundaries),
experiment and learn together and iterate quickly on best practices. That's what it is.

It might eventually become a non-profit if that's not too complicated or if those
goals are sufficiently upstreamed into "the Nix", dissolved.
