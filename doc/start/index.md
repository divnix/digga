# Quick Start
The only dependency is nix, so make sure you have it [installed][install-nix].

## Get the Template
Here is a snippet that will get you the template without the git history:
```sh
nix-shell -p cachix --run "cachix use nrdxp"

nix-shell https://github.com/divnix/devos/archive/master.tar.gz -A shell \
  --run "bud get master"

cd devos

nix-shell

git init
git add .
git commit -m init
```

This will place you in a new folder named `devos` with git initialized, and a
nix-shell that provides all the dependencies, including the unstable nix
version required.

In addition, the [binary cache](../integrations/cachix.md) is added for faster deployment.

> ##### _Notes:_
> - Flakes ignore files that have not been added to git, so be sure to stage new
>   files before building the system.
> - You can choose to simply clone the repo with git if you want to follow
>   upstream changes.
> - If the `nix-shell -p cachix --run "cachix use nrdxp"` line doesn't work
>   you can try with sudo: `sudo nix-shell -p cachix --run "cachix use nrdxp"`

## Next Steps:
- [Make installable ISO](./iso.md)
- [Bootstrap Host](./bootstrapping.md)
- [Already on NixOS](./from-nixos.md)
