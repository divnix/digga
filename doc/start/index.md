# Quick Start

The only dependency is nix, so make sure you have it [installed][install-nix].

## Get the Template

If you currently don't have flakes setup, you can utilize the digga shell to pull the template:

```sh
nix-shell "https://github.com/divnix/digga/archive/main.tar.gz" \
  --run "nix flake init -t github:divnix/digga"
```

If you already have flakes support, you can directly pull the template:

```sh
nix flake init -t github:divnix/digga
```

Then make sure to create the git repository:

```sh
git init
git add .
git commit -m init
```

To drop into a nix-shell, if you don't have flakes setup, use the digga shell to create a `flake.lock`:

```sh
nix-shell "https://github.com/divnix/digga/archive/main.tar.gz" \
  --run "nix flake lock"
```

Or if you do have flakes support, just run:

```sh
nix flake lock
```

Finally, run `nix-shell` to get to an interactive shell with all the dependencies, including the unstable nix
version required. You can run `menu` to confirm that you are using digga (expected output includes [docs], [general commands], [linter], etc.).

In addition, the [binary cache](../integrations/cachix.md) is added for faster deployment.

> ##### _Notes:_
>
> - Flakes ignore files that have not been added to git, so be sure to stage new
>   files before building the system.
> - You can choose to simply clone the repo with git if you want to follow
>   upstream changes.
> - If the `nix-shell -p cachix --run "cachix use nrdxp"` line doesn't work
>   you can try with sudo: `sudo nix-shell -p cachix --run "cachix use nrdxp"`
